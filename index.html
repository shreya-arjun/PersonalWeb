          <h3>Software Engineering Intern, Signadot</h3>
          <p>
            I worked in a software engineering role at Signadot this past summer, where I
            gained proficiency in cloud-native tools (Docker, Kubernetes), while utilizing Signadot's platform to create sandbox environments for efficient development and testing.
            I also experienced the SDLC by developing locally, creating pull requests, writing CI/CD tests, and aiding with bug fixes. 
            My debugging skills were strengthened by diagnosing production issues, identifying root causes, and deploying hotfixes. I also 
            authored concise tutorials illustrating product functionality and simplifying technical workflows for new users.

              Collaborative project that <b>utilized facial recognition to suggest songs based on user's displayed emotion.</b>
              I built upon fundamentals of software engineering, gaining insight into backend and database using JavaScript and MongoDB.
              Integrated facial recoginition API to convert an image into readable input, while recieving/tuning emotional scales based on user's emotion.

            <h3>PRISM</h3>
            <p>
              Project to <b>create visual aids during lecture speech</b> during PolyPrompt, an Open-Ai powered hackathon at CalPoly. 
              Developed an application that consumes speech, translates it to readable text, and generates images that correlate to the speech.
              I contributed to integrating APIs (Open-Ai, Claude) for speech-to-text and image generation within backend.
              Developed the UI, and worked on frontend with user-centered design, ideal for accessiblility for both students and professors.
