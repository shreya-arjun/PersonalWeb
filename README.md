# Personal Portfolio Starter

A clean, single-page portfolio site built with plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## Files

- `index.html` - page content and sections
- `styles.css` - visual design + responsive layout
- `script.js` - reveal animation + footer year
- `assets/TeslaRes.pdf` - your resume

## Customize

1. Edit headline/about/contact text in `index.html`.
2. Replace placeholder links:
   - GitHub: currently `https://github.com/`
   - LinkedIn: currently `https://www.linkedin.com/`
   - Email: currently `youremail@example.com`
3. Update project summaries so each card says:
   - What problem it solves
   - Tech stack
   - Your contribution
4. If needed, replace `assets/TeslaRes.pdf` with your latest resume.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run any static file server.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Push these files to your GitHub repo.
2. In GitHub: `Settings` -> `Pages`.
3. Under `Build and deployment`, choose:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` and `/ (root)`
4. Save. Your site will be live in about 1-2 minutes.

## Notes

- One project URL appears as `https://github.com/ellalyam/404Found...ers` (with `...`). If that is not the exact repo URL, replace it in `index.html`.
